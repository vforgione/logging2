# NOTE: This module does not provide handlers for rotating log files. The rationale behind that is that all *NIX systems
# have software specifically designed to do that, and it's much faster and reliable. Let's separate
# concerns here: this logging software is meant to be both Pythonic and fast. There's nothing Pythonic or fast about
# reinventing the wheel. A great utility is ``logrotate``, which is available for Debian, Red Hat, and BSD systems.
